![](Aspose.Words.884f3186-bb0a-44e1-b667-418bca04a5db.001.png)

**Issue Summary**

**Duration:** 2 hours (14:00 PST - 16:00 PST) **Impact:** Slow checkout process for users on the company e-commerce platform. Users experienced extended loading times and delays during the payment processing stage. Estimated 30% of users were affected during the peak traffic period. **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion due to a recent database configuration change.

**Timeline**

- **14:00 PST:** Monitoring alerts triggered indicating a spike in response times for the checkout API.
- **14:01 PST:** On-call engineer investigates and identifies slow database queries during the payment processing step.
- **14:10 PST:** Initial assumption is database overload due to increased traffic. Team investigates database resource utilization and queries currently running.
- **14:30 PST:** Database team joins the investigation. No unusual traffic patterns are identified on the database server.
- **14:45 PST:** The investigation expands to the application layer and database connection pool configuration. Recent code deployments are reviewed.
- **15:00 PST:** The root cause is identified as a misconfiguration in the database connection pool size after a recent database upgrade. The pool was not scaled to accommodate the increased load.
- **15:15 PST:** The database team updates the connection pool configuration to a higher value.
- **15:30 PST:** Monitoring confirms a decrease in response times for the checkout API. Checkout process functionality is verified.
- **16:00 PST:** The incident is declared resolved.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause of the slowdown was an insufficient database connection pool size. A recent database upgrade involved changes to connection settings, but the application's connection pool configuration remained unchanged. This resulted in the pool running out of available connections during peak traffic, leading to slow database queries and delayed payment processing.

The issue was resolved by increasing the database connection pool size within the application to a value that could accommodate the current database load. This ensured a sufficient number of available connections for the application to handle concurrent user requests during checkout.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

- **Improve Communication:** A more thorough review process will be implemented for future database configuration changes. This will involve communication and collaboration between the database and application development teams to ensure compatibility with existing application settings.
- **Automated Testing:** Automated integration tests will be developed to specifically target database interactions during the checkout process. These tests will be integrated into the continuous integration pipeline to catch similar configuration issues before deployment.
- **Monitoring Enhancements:** Existing monitoring for the database connection pool will be expanded to include metrics on available connections and pool utilization. This will provide early warnings of potential connection exhaustion scenarios.
- **Documentation Review:** The documentation for the database connection pool configuration will be reviewed and updated to reflect best practices for scaling the pool size based on anticipated database load.

This postmortem outlines the investigation and resolution of a database connection pool issue that caused a slowdown in the e-commerce checkout process. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a smooth and efficient checkout experience for our users.
